JVMPin needs to solve the following problem/usecase:

Provide an integration path to use clojurescript with nodejs via npm or grunt.

We assume that java is installed by either testing 'java' is on the PATH or found
in a JAVA_HOME/JRE_HOME if specified. If it is not fail.

We also assume that the nailgun server jar is not provided. (downloaded on installation
with this library).

This makes the JVMPin more than a simple ng-client (as was the original goal).

Firstly we must provided a validation route to make sure that all the prerequisits
are fulfilled. This should be placed in an isolated module which performs said checks.

* Verify java is installed
* Download nailgun jar into a cache if it doesn't exist.
* Download clojurescript jar into cache if doesn't exist.
* Check for availible port to start JVM instance on & start it.

Secondly we must make use of the current JVMPin implementation but divide it into
suitable components. (one of process, the other of socket). The clientConnect should
connect to a running jvm instance (spun up as a child process). This is currently
outside of the scope of the JVMPin implementation and should be exclusive to the 
clojure compiler.
