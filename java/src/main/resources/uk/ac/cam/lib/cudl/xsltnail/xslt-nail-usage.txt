Apply an XSLT program to an XML document passed on stdin.

%s

Positional Arguments:
    <xslt-file>
        The filesystem path to XSLT file to execute.

    <xml-file>
        The filesystem path to the input data to transform. Stdin is read if -
        is specified.

Options:
    --system-identifier <uri>
        The URI of the XML input - e.g. a file:// URI identifying the location
        of the XML file. If <xml-file> is specified, this defaults to the URL
        of the file.
    -h, --help  Show this information
    --version   Show the version

Notes:
    The input "XML" file doesn't actually need to be XML, it can be any data
    that the XSLT program expects, but generally is XML.
