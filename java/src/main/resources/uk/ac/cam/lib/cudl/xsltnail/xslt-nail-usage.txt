Apply an XSLT program to an XML document passed on stdin.

%s

Positional Arguments:
    <xslt-file>
        The filesystem path to XSLT file to execute.

    <xml-file>
        The filesystem path to the input data to transform. Stdin is read if -
        is specified.

Options:
    --system-identifier <uri>
        The URI of the XML input - e.g. a file:// URI identifying the location
        of the XML file. If <xml-file> is specified, this defaults to the URL
        of the file.
    --parameter <name=value>
        Set a stylesheet global parameter value. The value is of the form
        "{uri}name=value". This option can be repeated to set multiple separate
        parameters, or to provide multiple values for the same parameter. Values
        are strings, which are converted to the parameter's declared type using
        the standard type conversion rules for the XSLT stylesheet being
        executed.
    -h, --help  Show this information
    --version   Show the version

Notes:
    The input "XML" file doesn't actually need to be XML, it can be any data
    that the XSLT program expects, but generally is XML.
