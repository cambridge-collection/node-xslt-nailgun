Execute a nail command on a nailgun server.

Usage:
  jvmpin-ng [options] <class-or-alias> [<arg>...]

Options:
  --nailgun-server=<host>
  --host=<host>
    The server to connect to.
 
  --nailgun-port=<port>
  --port=<port>
    The port to connect to.
 
  --path=<path>
    The path to the IPC endpoint to use to connect to the server (UNIX domain
    socket / Windows named pipe).
 
  --stdin-policy=<policy>
    Defines how stdin data is sent to the server. Default: once-per-request
    Possible values are:
      all-after-request: Don't send any stdin data until a SEND_STDIN chunk is
        received, then send data as fast as possible. This is the behaviour
        described in http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/protocol.html but
        is not supported by nailgun-server 1.0.0.
      once-per-request: Send a single STDIN chunk per SEND_STDIN chunk received
        from the server. This is the behaviour expected by nailgun-server 1.0.0.
      all-before-request: Send stdin data as fast as possible as soon as the
        initial handshake is complete. This behaviour was previously jvmpin's
        default, and is required by older nailgun servers which didn't transmit
        SEND_STDIN chunks.
 
  --heartbeat=<interval>
    The number of milliseconds between heartbeat messages sent to keep the
    connection alive. 0 disables heartbeats entirely. Default: 1000
