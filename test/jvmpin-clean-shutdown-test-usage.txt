Verify that jvmpin does not hold the node process open

A command is executed and either allowed to complete normally, or killed
prematurely. In either case node should be able to shutdown at the end of the
event loop's iteration.

Usage:
    jvmpin-clean-shutdown-test.js [options]

Options:
    --kill           Kill the jvmpin process before it's completed.
